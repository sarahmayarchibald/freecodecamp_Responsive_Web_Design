                        Roy Lichtenstein developed a passion for art at an early age. He attended the Franklin School for Boys in New York City, where he honed his drawing skills and fostered his creative instincts. After graduating, he enrolled at Ohio State University to study art and design. Lichtenstein's education was interrupted by World War II when he served in the United States Army, but upon his return, he resumed his studies, eventually earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.

                <p>
                    In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Roy Lichtenstein began to experiment with different artistic styles and techniques. Initially influenced by Abstract Expressionism, he gradually shifted towards a more distinctive style, drawing inspiration from the world of popular culture. In 1961, Lichtenstein painted his first work in the comic book-inspired style that would define his career. Titled "Look Mickey," this piece marked the beginning of his exploration into the realm of Pop Art.

                    Roy Lichtenstein's artistic style is characterised by its bold lines, vibrant colours, and the use of Benday dotsâ€”a printing technique employed in comic books and commercial printing. He adopted the visual language of popular culture, appropriating and reimagining images from comic books, advertisements, and consumer goods. Lichtenstein's works often depicted dramatic and emotionally charged scenes, capturing moments of action, romance, and humour. Through his art, he questioned the boundaries between high and low culture and examined the impact of mass media on society.
